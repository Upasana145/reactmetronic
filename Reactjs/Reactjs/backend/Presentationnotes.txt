Some important question that i think they may ask??

1. what is node.js?
2. what is react.js?
3. what is express.js?
4. what is axios? why do we use?




1. Node.js:
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute 
JavaScript code on the server. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by 
the Google Chrome web browser to execute JavaScript code. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking
 I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications. It enables 
 developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript, which was traditionally used only for 
 client-side scripting in web browsers.


2. React.js:
React.js, commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently 
manage the state of the application. It follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into
 small, self-contained components that can be easily composed to build complex user interfaces. React uses a 
 virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the actual DOM, which helps in improving performance 
 and reducing unnecessary re-renders.


3. Express.js:
Express.js, often simply referred to as Express, is a minimalistic, open-source web application framework for 
Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications and APIs. Express is lightweight,
 flexible, and unopinionated, meaning it doesn't impose strict conventions on how developers should structure 
 their applications. This allows developers to have more control over their application's architecture and
  design. Express provides various middleware functions that can be easily integrated to handle routing, HTTP 
  requests, and response processing, making it easy to create robust and scalable web applications.



4. Axios:
Axios is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js.
It provides an easy-to-use API for performing asynchronous HTTP operations such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Axios supports promises, which makes it convenient to handle asynchronous code. It can be used to interact 
with RESTful APIs and fetch data from external servers. Axios is widely used in modern web development to 
handle API calls and manage data fetching in frontend applications. Its simplicity, ease of use, and wide 
adoption make it a popular choice among developers.

Title: Template Integration of Metronic in React.js with Node.js and MySQL Backend

Introduction:
Hello everyone, today I am excited to present my project on the template integration of Metronic UI 
in React.js as the frontend and utilizing Node.js as the backend with MySQL for database connectivity.

Project Overview:
The main goal of this project was to integrate the powerful Metronic UI templates into a React.js 
frontend, while also implementing a Node.js backend with MySQL as the database. I focused on providing
 key functionalities to users, such as login, logout, and signup. Once users sign up, their data is securely 
 stored in MySQL, with password and email ID validations to ensure strong security. Passwords are also 
 encrypted before being stored in the database. Let's delve into the details:

Frontend Development (React.js with Metronic):
In this part of the project, I utilized React.js to build the frontend and seamlessly integrated Metronic UI 
templates to create an intuitive user interface. By using React Router, I enabled smooth navigation between 
different pages within the application. To manage state effectively, I leveraged the useState hook.
 Additionally, I implemented toggle functionality to enhance the user experience.

Backend Development (Node.js):
For the backend, I opted for Node.js, which allowed me to set up user authentication for login and signup 
processes. I also incorporated strong password and email ID validations to ensure data integrity. To enhance
 security, user passwords are encrypted before being stored in the MySQL database.

Database Connectivity (MySQL):
MySQL served as the database for this project. I designed an appropriate schema to store user data, 
including login credentials and other relevant information. The user signup process saves the data securely 
to the MySQL database.

Dashboard Page Functionality:
The dashboard page is a vital part of the application, providing users with various functionalities.
 By using React Router, users can effortlessly navigate to different pages within the dashboard. I also 
 implemented a logout feature to ensure secure user sessions.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project successfully integrated the Metronic UI templates into a React.js frontend,
while employing Node.js as the backend and MySQL for database connectivity. Key functionalities such as login,
logout, signup, and secure password and email validations were implemented. The dashboard page offers 
an intuitive user experience with additional features like toggling and page navigation. Thank you for 
your attention, and I'm now open to any questions you may have.













SignIn page explanation





Sure, let's go through the `Signin` component code line by line:

1. `import React, { useState } from "react";`: This line imports the `React` library and the `useState` hook from the 
`react` package. The `useState` hook allows us to add state to functional components.

2. `import { Link, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";`: This line imports the `Link` component and the `useNavigate`
 hook from the `react-router-dom` package. The `Link` component is used for navigation within the application, and the 
 `useNavigate` hook allows programmatic navigation to different routes.

3. The next few lines import various SVG files and an illustration image as components using the `import` statement. 
These files are likely to be used as icons or images in the UI.

4. `import Validation from "./LoginValidation";`: This line imports the `Validation` function from the `LoginValidation.js` file, which presumably contains some validation logic for the login form.

5. `import axios from "axios";`: This line imports the `axios` library, which is a popular library used for making HTTP
 requests.

6. `function Signin() {`: This line declares the functional component `Signin`.

7. `const [values, setValues] = useState({ email: "", password: "" });`: This line uses the `useState` hook to initialize 
a state called `values`. The `values` state is an object with two properties, `email` and `password`, both initialized
 with empty strings.

8. `const navigate = useNavigate();`: This line uses the `useNavigate` hook to create a `navigate` function, which allows
 for programmatic navigation within the application.

9. `const [error, setErrors] = useState({});`: This line uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state called `error`. 
The `error` state is an object that will be used to store any validation errors during form submission.

10. `const handleInput = (event) => { ... }`: This is a function that handles the `onChange` event for the input fields
 (`email` and `password`). When the user types in the input fields, this function updates the corresponding values in the
  `values` state.

11. `axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;`: This line sets the default configuration for Axios requests to include 
credentials (such as cookies) in cross-origin requests. This is likely used for authentication purposes.

12. `const handleSubmit = (event) => { ... }`: This is a function that handles the form submission when the user clicks on the "Continue" button. It first prevents the default form submission behavior to avoid page reload. Then, it calls the `Validation` function to perform client-side validation on the `values` object and stores any validation errors in the `error` state.

13. After validating the form data, it makes a POST request to the server at "http://localhost:8081/login" with the `values` object as the request body.

14. If the response from the server contains a `Status` property with the value "Success," it uses the `navigate` function to redirect the user to the "/dashboard" route. Otherwise, it displays an alert with the message "error."

15. The remaining part of the code contains JSX (JavaScript XML) that defines the structure and content of the login page. The JSX code includes the logo, login form, and social media login options (Google, Facebook, Apple).

16. Various Bootstrap classes and inline styles are used to style the elements on the page, such as buttons, input fields, and the overall layout.

17. `console.log(values, "================");`: This line logs the `values` state to the console. This is for debugging purposes and helps to check the current state of the `values` object.

That's a complete breakdown of the `Signin` component code. It handles user input for the login form, performs validation, and handles form submission with the ability to navigate to the dashboard or show an alert message based on the response from the server. Additionally, it provides options for users to sign in using Google, Facebook, or Apple accounts.













SignUp page explanation:---







Sure, let's go through the `Signup` component code line by line:

1. `import React,{useState} from "react";`: This line imports the `React` library and the `useState` hook from 
the `react` package. The `useState` hook allows us to add state to functional components.

2. The next few lines import various SVG files and an image as components using the `import` statement. These 
files are likely to be used as icons or images in the UI.

3. `import {Link, useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom';`: This line imports the `Link` component and the 
`useNavigate` hook from the `react-router-dom` package. The `Link` component is used for navigation within 
the application, and the `useNavigate` hook allows programmatic navigation to different routes.

4. `import Validation from './Signupvalidation';`: This line imports the `Validation` function from the
 `Signupvalidation.js` file, which presumably contains some validation logic for the signup form.

5. `import axios from "axios";`: This line imports the `axios` library, which is a popular library used 
for making HTTP requests.

6. `function Signup() {`: This line declares the functional component `Signup`.

7. `const [values, setValues] = useState({ firstname : '', lastname: '', email : '', password: '', });`: 
This line uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state called `values`. The `values` state is an object 
with properties `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, and `password`, all initialized with empty strings.

8. `const navigate = useNavigate();`: This line uses the `useNavigate` hook to create a `navigate` function, 
which allows for programmatic navigation within the application.

9. `const [error,setErrors] = useState({})`: This line uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state called 
`error`. The `error` state is an object that will be used to store any validation errors during form submission.

10. `const handleInput = (event) => { ... }`: This is a function that handles the `onChange` event for the
 input fields (`firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, and `password`). When the user types in the input fields,
  this function updates the corresponding values in the `values` state.

11. `const handleSubmit = (event) => { ... }`: This is a function that handles the form submission when the 
user clicks on the "Submit" button. It first prevents the default form submission behavior to avoid page reload. 
Then, it calls the `Validation` function to perform client-side validation on the `values` object and stores any 
validation errors in the `error` state.

12. If there are no validation errors (i.e., all fields have been filled correctly), it makes a POST request 
to the server at "http://localhost:8081/signup" with the `values` object as the request body.

13. After receiving the response from the server, if the `Status` property in the response data is "Success," 
it uses the `navigate` function to redirect the user to the home page ("/"). Otherwise, it displays an alert
 with the message "Error."

14. The remaining part of the code contains JSX (JavaScript XML) that defines the structure and content of the
 signup page.

15. Various Bootstrap classes and inline styles are used to style the elements on the page, such as buttons,
 input fields, and the overall layout.

16. Conditional rendering is used to show validation error messages below each input field if there are any
 errors in the `error` state.

17. The `handleSubmit` function is called when the "Submit" button is clicked.

That's a complete breakdown of the `Signup` component code. It handles user input for the signup form, performs 
validation, and handles form submission with the ability to navigate to the home page or show an alert message 
based on the response from the server.
















// seerver.js file explanation------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>








Sure! I'll explain the code you provided line by line:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mysql = require('mysql');
const cors = require('cors');
const jwt  = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const cookieParser  = require('cookie-parser');
```

In the beginning, the code imports required modules: `express`, `mysql`, `cors`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, and 
`cookie-parser`.

```javascript
const app = express();

app.use(cors({
  origin: ["http://localhost:3000"],
  methods: ['POST', "GET"],
  credentials: true
}));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cookieParser());
```

- `express()` creates an instance of the Express application.
- `app.use(cors(...))` sets up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware to allow requests from 
`http://localhost:3000` with methods "POST" and "GET" and allow credentials.
- `app.use(express.json())` is a built-in middleware to parse incoming JSON requests.
- `app.use(cookieParser())` is a middleware to parse cookies.

```javascript
const db = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: '',
  database: 'signup',
});
```

This code creates a connection to the MySQL database using the credentials provided.

```javascript
const salt = 10; // Define the number of salt rounds for bcrypt
```

A constant `salt` is defined to determine the number of salt rounds used for password hashing with `bcrypt`.

```javascript
const verifyUser = (req, res, next) => {
  // Middleware to verify user authentication based on the token
  // It checks if the request contains a valid JWT token in the cookie.
  // If the token is valid, it decodes the token and sets the decoded name in the request.
  // If the token is invalid or missing, it sends an error response.
  // This middleware is used to protect routes that require authentication.

  const token = req.cookies.token;
  if (!token) {
    return res.json({ Error: "You are not authenticated" });
  } else {
    jwt.verify(token, "jwt-secret-key", (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.json({ Error: "Token is not okay" });
      } else {
        req.name = decoded.name;
        next();
      }
    });
  }
};
```

This is a middleware function called `verifyUser` that checks if the user is authenticated by verifying the JWT
 token present in the request cookie. If the token is valid, it decodes the token and sets the decoded name in the
  request (`req.name`). If the token is invalid or missing, it sends an error response.

```javascript
app.get('/', verifyUser, (req, res) => {
  return res.json({ Status: "Success", name: req.name });
});
```

This is a route handler for the root URL ("/") that uses the `verifyUser` middleware to protect the route. If the user
 is authenticated (i.e., the token is valid), it returns a JSON response with a "Success" status and the user's name. 
 Otherwise, it will return an error response.

```javascript
app.post('/signup', (req, res) => {
  // This route handles user signup. It inserts a new user record into the 'login' table with hashed password.
  // The password is hashed using bcrypt before storing it in the database.

  const sql = 'INSERT INTO login (`firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `password`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)';

  bcrypt.hash(req.body.password.toString(), salt, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return res.json({ Error: 'Error for hashing password' });
    }

    const values = [req.body.firstname, req.body.lastname, req.body.email, hash];

    db.query(sql, values, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error inserting data:', err);
        return res.json({ Error: 'Inserting data Error in server' });
      }

      return res.json({ Status: 'Success' });
    });
  });
});
```

This route handles user signup. When a POST request is made to "/signup" with the required user information 
(firstname, lastname, email, and password), it inserts a new user record into the 'login' table in the database.
 The password is hashed using bcrypt before storing it.

```javascript
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // This route handles user login. It verifies the provided email and password with the stored hashed password.
  // If the login is successful, it generates a JWT token and sets it in a cookie.

  const sql = 'SELECT * FROM login WHERE `email` = ?';

  db.query(sql, [req.body.email], (err, data) => {
    if (!req.body.email || !req.body.password) {
      return res.json({ Error: "Email and password fields are required." });
    }

    if (err) {
      console.error('Error querying data:', err);
      return res.json({ Error: "Login error in server" });
    }

    if (data.length > 0) {
      bcrypt.compare(req.body.password.toString(), data[0].password, (err, response) => {
        if (err) return res.json({ Error: "Password compare error" });

        if (response) {
          // If the password is correct, generate a JWT token and set it in a cookie
          const name = data[0].name;
          const token = jwt.sign({ name }, "jwt-secret-key", { expiresIn: '1d' });
          res.cookie('token', token);
          return res.json({ Status: "Success" });
        } else {
          return res.json({ Error: "Password not matched" });
        }
      });
    } else {
      return res.json({ Error: "No email existed" });
    }
  });
});
```

This route handles user login. When a POST request is made to "/login" with the user's email and password, 
it verifies the provided email and password with the stored hashed password in the 'login' table. If the login
 is successful (i.e., the email and password match), it generates a JWT token and sets it in a cookie. This token 
 will be used for user authentication in subsequent requests.

```javascript
app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
  // This route handles user logout. It clears the JWT token cookie.

  res.clearCookie('token'); // Clear the cookie named 'token'
  return res.json({ Status: "Success" });
});
```

This route handles user logout. When a GET request is made to "/logout", it clears the JWT token cookie, effectively 
logging out the user.

```javascript
app.listen(8081, () => {
  console.log('listening');
});
```

The server listens on port 8081 for incoming requests. When the server is running, it logs "listening" to the console.
